Ghiblist
==================
## Inspiration
I've always been a big fan of Studio Ghibli films! The art style and characters are always so memorable. I wanted to build something as a tribute to the franchise.

## What it does
Ghiblist is a list of different characters from various Studio Ghibli films. Each character has its own "card" with the name of the character, the film the character is from, a funny quote, and a link to their Wiki page. Users can organize the characters by movie or alphabetical order.

## How we built it
I used Qoom as my text editor. The languages I used were HTML/CSS/JS. I also used .json.

## Challenges we ran into
I had to figure out how to get my search features to work properly and tie my JavaScript code with my HTML elements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of my final product. I also think my UI design flows well and has the same peaceful ambience as the Studio Ghibli films. I know that this is a product that my fellow Studio Ghibli fans would find exciting to explore different characters and compare favorites!

## What we learned
I learned how to create sorting features in JS and use flex attributes in CSS.

## What's next for Ghiblist
I want to keep expanding the Ghiblist inventory to include more films! I want to also add more information on each character card to be more comprehensive.
